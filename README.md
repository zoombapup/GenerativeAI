# GenerativeAI
A list of resources around generative content and machine learning - Compiled by Phil Carlisle (Generative Machines/University of Lincoln)
Note: inclusion in the list isn't any form of endorsement. Some of these resources are commercial and require money, I'll try and highlight Open Source where possible.
Also note: I'll keep a list of academic papers in another document so that this is more about resources to play with.
